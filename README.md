# CYK Algorithm for Context-Free Grammars

This repository contains Python code that implements the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm for parsing sentences using context-free grammars in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The CYK algorithm is a classical parsing technique used in computational linguistics and natural language processing.

## Introduction

The CYK algorithm is an efficient parsing algorithm for context-free grammars that are in CNF. It determines whether a given sentence can be generated by a given grammar and constructs a parse tree if it exists.

## Features

- Parses sentences using context-free grammars in CNF.
- Constructs and prints parse trees for valid sentences.
- Handles grammars and sentences entered by the user.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cyk-algorithm.git
   cd cyk-algorithm
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies. Ensure you have Python 3 and pip installed. Install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy  # (if not installed)
   pip install pandas  # (if not installed)
   pip install scikit-learn  # (if not installed)
   ```

## Usage

To use the CYK algorithm, run the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

Follow the prompts to input grammar rules in CNF and a sentence to check.

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Grammar and Sentence

```python
custom_grammar = [
    ('S', ['NP', 'VP']),
    ('NP', ['Det', 'N']),
    ('VP', ['V', 'NP']),
    ('Det', ['the']),
    ('N', ['cat', 'dog']),
    ('V', ['chased', 'ate'])
]

custom_sentence = ['the', 'cat', 'chased', 'the', 'dog']

result = cyk_algorithm(custom_grammar, custom_sentence)
print(f"The sentence {' '.join(custom_sentence)} is{' ' if result else ' not '}recognized by the provided grammar.")
```

### Example 2: Complex Grammar and Sentence

```python
complex_grammar = [
    ('S', ['NP', 'VP']),
    ('NP', ['Det', 'N']),
    ('VP', ['V', 'NP']),
    ('Det', ['a', 'an', 'the']),
    ('N', ['dog', 'cat', 'bat']),
    ('V', ['chased', 'caught'])
]

long_sentence = "the dog chased the cat".split()

result = cyk_algorithm(complex_grammar, long_sentence)
print(f"The sentence {' '.join(long_sentence)} is{' ' if result else ' not '}recognized by the grammar.")
```
